# Particle in a 1D Infinite Potential Well

This project numerically solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation
for a particle confined in a 1D infinite potential well using MATLAB.

## Methods
- Finite-difference discretization of the second derivative
- Matrix eigenvalue solution for energy levels and wavefunctions

## Results
- Computed energy eigenvalues agree with analytic solutions
- Visualized probability densities for the lowest energy states

## Notes
This project was completed as a learning exercise in numerical quantum
mechanics and MATLAB.
